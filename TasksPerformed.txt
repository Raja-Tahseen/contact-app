7. Add contacts from the Form to a Dynamic "contacts" list in App.js  & empty Form fields after submition in AddContact.js. And show added contacts in ContactList.js
 a)Remove static "contacts" Array from "App.js" and utilize React Hook => 'useState' that allows to add state to your functional components.
 b)Use array destructuring to declare a state variable called contacts and a function called setContacts to update that state in App.js
 c)Added '<AddContact addContactHandler={addContactHandler} />' as child in App.js to receieve form submitted data and use addContactHandler propety as handler to update the state.
 d)In AddContact.js class component add onChange event in name and email fields to set the State of both with the entered values + Add value attribute and assign state prop value.
 e)Make form submitable. Then check validation of not empty fields. Then assign "this.props.addContactHandler(this.state)"
 f)To make form fields empty again =>   this.setState({ name: "", email: "" });

8.On refreshing page data is lost. Make use of Local Storage (Utilize React hook -> 'useEffect').
 a)Import 'useEffect', define LocalStorageKey
 b)Then define 2 useEffect() to store contacts state array data as json.stringify and to to retrieve it when page is refreshed.
